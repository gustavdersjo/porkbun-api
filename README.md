# Porkbun API interface 🐷🐖

Porkbun is an amazingly awesome ICANN
accredited domain name registrar.
This is a tool to interface with their
equally amazingly awesome API, 
targeting v3 at the time of writing.

The tool can be used either through the
commandline or as a python libary, and
comes with built-in support for some
common usecases such as handling DDNS
or SSL verification over DNS. Oink! 🐖
